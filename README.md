# Ruby Word Search
The final project for Ruby 2 at Spokane Community College

The program first creates a 45 x 45 grid

It then takes a list of words within a .txt file and randomly arranges those
words within the grid.  

The logic ensures that the words will be placed within the grid either 
horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or backwards.

Once the words are placed random letters are placed in the remaining
open spaces
